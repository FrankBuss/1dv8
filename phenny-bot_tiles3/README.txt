Installation &c.

1) Run ./phenny - this creates a default config file
2) Edit ~/.phenny/default.py
3) Run ./phenny - this now runs phenny with your settings

"start" is a script to kill the old process and start a new one.
If you have already a ~/.phenny directory, delete it before first start.

Enjoy!
